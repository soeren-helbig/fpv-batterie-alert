# FPV Batterie Alert

This project is an Arduino Nano based batterie alert. 

* Balancer Connector should be connected to A1-A3 & A6 - voltage devider needed!!!
* Buzzer is connected to D13
* OLED Display (128 x 32) is connected to A4/A5 (SDA / SCL)

I use this project for the Fatshark Shark Byte RX system, powered by a 4S lipo.
